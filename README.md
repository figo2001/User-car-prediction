## Overview

Accurately predicting the price of a used car can be a complex task due to the numerous factors involved, such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, condition, and more. This project demonstrates how to approach this problem using machine learning, from data collection and preprocessing to model selection and evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Multiple regression model implementations
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various used cars, including attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, and price. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or use your own dataset.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-car-price-prediction.git
    cd used-car-price-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step is crucial for improving model performance.

    ```python
    python data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can help the model better understand the relationships in the data.

    ```python
    python feature_engineering.py
    ```

3. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models on the processed data. This includes splitting the data into training and test sets, training the models, and performing hyperparameter tuning.

    ```python
    python model_training.py
    ```

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.

    ```python
    python evaluation.py
    ```

## Model Training

We explore multiple regression models in this project, including but not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters for each model.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the models using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

Visualize the results using plots to understand the performance of each model and make informed decisions.

## Results

Summarize the results of the best-performing model, including the evaluation metrics and visualizations. Discuss any insights gained from the feature importance and the model's predictions.
